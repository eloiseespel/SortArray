# SortArray
Github homework for COSC 499 at UBCO

This repo offers different array sorting methods in C# 
1. Sorting through default sort using Array.Sort, note this is directly available through the system therefore easier to use but gives you less control over how you wish to sort your arrays.
This method also comes with unit tests.

2. Sorting through custom sort. The advantage of custom sort is that the user can define their own sorting parameters (for exemple sorting an array of integrers in desccending order). 
This method will come with unit tests however, for now unit customeSortTest.cs is broken, I am working on it and it will be fixed in an upcoming iteration.
