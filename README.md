# SortArray
Github homework for COSC 499 at UBCO

This repo offers different array sorting methods in C# 
1. Sorting through default sort using Array.Sort, note this is directly available through the system therefore easier to use but gives you less control over how you wish to sort your arrays.
This method also comes with unit tests.
